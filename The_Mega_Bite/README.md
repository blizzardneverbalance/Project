### The Mega Bite
This is a simplified web app using Flask and SQLAlchemy.<br />
This app allows users to enter and save information about restaurants.<br />
Users will then be able to query that information based on several criteria.<br />
>Each restaurant will have the following information:
>>name: the restaurant name.
>>location: the name of the city where the restaurant is located.
>>category: what kind of food does this restaurant serve?
>>price: 1 for cheap to 4 for expensive.

The app will store this information in a splite database named restaurants.db. A restaurant id will be assigned automatically and it will be used the primary key for the table.
