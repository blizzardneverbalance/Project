### The Mega Bite
This is a simplified web app using Flask and SQLAlchemy.<br />
This app allows users to enter and save information about restaurants.<br />
Users will then be able to query that information based on several criteria.<br />
Each restaurant will have the following information:
>name: the restaurant name.<br />
>location: the name of the city where the restaurant is located.<br />
>category: what kind of food does this restaurant serve?
>price: 1 for cheap to 4 for expensive.

The app will store this information in a splite database named restaurants.db. A restaurant id will be assigned automatically and it will be used the primary key for the table.<br />

Initally, before any restaurants are added to the database, the application will show the following on its home page:
